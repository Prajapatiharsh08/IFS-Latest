            question: 'How does the quarterly compounding work?',
            answer: "Our quarterly compounding model provides a 6% return every quarter on your investment.

This creates an accelerating growth curve for your investment."

You can designate up to 5 family members who will receive an equal share of this 30%. This system helps create generational wealth and financial security for your loved ones.'

        {
            id: 'panel7',
            question: 'What happens if I want to add more to my investment?',
            answer: 'You can add to your existing investment at any time. Additional investments will be treated as separate investments with their own quarterly compounding cycle, or you can choose to merge them with your existing investment.'
        },
        {
            id: 'panel8',

        },
        {
            id: 'panel10',
            question: 'What happens to my investment in case of my demise?',
            answer: "In the unfortunate event of an investor's demise, the investment and future returns are transferred to the nominated beneficiary as per the details provided during registration. We have a streamlined process to ensure a smooth transition during such difficult times."
